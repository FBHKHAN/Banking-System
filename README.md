# Banking System 

This is one of my homework assignments assigned in "Advanced Programming Techniques" course. The idea is to use file for input and output and implement all real world banking functions which include the following:

- Account Creation 
- Deposit
- Withdrawal 
- Show Transaction history
- Balance Check
- Close Account, etc.

# Output
##### New Account:
